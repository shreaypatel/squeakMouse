This repository contains the CAD files and design documentation for a custom mouse enclosure, created as part of the [Hack Club Squeak](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/starter-projects/squeak) initiative.

The Design Process

1. The design began with the import of the official design files for the Bambu mouse kit. Next the base of the enclosure was created from the bottom view to fully encase the baseboard. 

2. Sculpting the Shape; A side profile was sketched and "extruded remove" was used to carve the ergonomic arch out of the solid block, defining the mouse's hand feel.

3. Hollowing the Interior; The solid body was "shelled" from the bottom face (2mm thickness) to create the cavity for the electronics while maintaining structural strength.

4. Scroll Wheel & Buttons; A slot was cut for the scroll wheel, and the left/right clickers were modeled as cantilever wedges—separated from the main body by a thin gap to allow them to flex and actuate the switches.

5. Mounting & Refinement; Finally, internal screw holes were added to secure the top shell to the base, and edges were filleted for comfort. This step concluded the design process. Lastly, design errors were identified and corrected while maximizing ergonomic comfort.

6. Conclusion: This project proved to be a fun challenge that introduced me to the world of 3D printed hardware. Overall, I learned more about the mechanical design process on onshape and how a mouse actually works.
