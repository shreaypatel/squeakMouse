This repo contains the CAD files and design documentation for a custom mouse enclosure, created as part of the [Hack Club Squeak](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/starter-projects/squeak) initiative.

The Design Process

1. The design began with the import of the official design files for the Bambu mouse kit. Next, I created the base of the enclosure from the bottom view to fully encase the baseboard.

2. I siwtched my view to the left plane and began a new sketch for the side profile of the mouse. By using a series of simple lines and curves I was able to create a sleek yet ergonomic design for the mouse enclosure by extruding the excess solid mass.

3. I used the shell feature to create the cavity for the electronics while maintaining structural strength. This also reduces the amount filament required to print the mouse components. 

4. I created a new sketch on the plane of the scroll wheel and cut out a slot to allow for its spinning motion. Each clicker on the left and right side of the mouse got its own wedge to push down on it so each right click and left click button worked. Lastly, I made sure they fit the required design constraints.

5. Next I made a new sketch to divide the mouse into its left and right clicker side. These parts cannot be connected or there would be no difference between a left and right click.

6. Finally, I added internal screw holes to secure the top shell to the base, and filleted some of the edges for comfort and design asthetics. This step concluded the design process. Lastly, I identified and corrected any design errors while going over the tutorial documentation to see if any steps were missed.

7. Conclusion: This project proved to be a fun challenge that introduced me to the world of 3D printed hardware. Overall, I learned more about the mechanical design process on onshape and how a mouse actually works.
